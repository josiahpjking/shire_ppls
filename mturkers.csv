  3UUIU9GZC553CVCRKQON4JIEZZQT5T	  A1S25NBTJQC64E	  100% (1/1)	  PBeHRh I enjoyed doing this experience, it was different.	mtrack_loy 4
  3UUIU9GZC553CVCRKQON4JIEZZQT5T	  A1LBQT5SJI6F3R	  100% (2/2)	  GREENBERG . It took me almost 8 min to complete the task. I think it was about the research to see how people are influenced what they choose by how some one says truth or lie.	mtrack_loy 4
  3UUIU9GZC553CVCRKQON4JIEZZQT5T	  A15SL0SEPN61TD	  100% (1/1)	  GREENBERG it took me around 10 minutes to complete the task. I believe it was studying the way people lie and how we judge it based on the way they talk.	mtrack_loy 4
  3UUIU9GZC553CVCRKQON4JIEZZQT5T	  A9IRQ05LHE0KQ	  100% (1/1)	  GREENBERG completed in 16:25 min, took a few minutes to resize window. MY guess is that the test is about how people react to confidence of voice.	mtrack_loy 4

  3DFYDSXB2W0QJ7619XIRAPNL0BLUJU	  A3HR5PPIQ5ZGHE	  100% (1/1)	  GREENBERG Task took me just over 7 minutes. I figured you were testing to see if 'umms' and 'uhs' made it easier for people to sense a lie or not.	mtrack_loy 3

  38G0E1M85M5ZA26VQMWADDYFV2CVU8	  A3PYV60XFJIGSO	  100% (1/1)	"  GREENBERG Task took about 12 mins and I think you were testing whether people are more likely to believe someone when they use fillers such as ""urmm"""	mtrack_loy 5
  38G0E1M85M5ZA26VQMWADDYFV2CVU8	  ASMSCHRHB9FML	  100% (1/1)	  The game stops loading each time at a certain point, I tried three times with the last code of: AMYfPp. The circle just continuously rotates in the centre. Probably takes me approx. 5-10mins before it crashes. Sounds like you're testing if humans are able to tell the difference between truth or lies via tone of voice or words used.	mtrack_loy 5
  38G0E1M85M5ZA26VQMWADDYFV2CVU8	  A2INGIZ3TMH7Q9	  100% (1/1)	  GREENBERG Took me 5 minutes-can't guess what you are testing -maybe voice deception detection if that is even a thing or concept?	mtrack_loy 5
  38G0E1M85M5ZA26VQMWADDYFV2CVU8	  AVRDGPOFATVAR	  100% (1/1)	  GREENBERG (took about 5 minutes, I guess I was testing whether you can tell somebody is lying without having the chance to think about it for that long.)	mtrack_loy 5

  3ATYLI1PRT2V62M4DB6IBJVWHKYJOW	  AOEVZM74U1SVT	  100% (1/1)	  Completion code: GREENBERG, 18minutes. I believe that the test was based on the manner of delivery and general speech i.e. stuttering etc.	mtrack_loy 2

  3ATYLI1PRT2V62M4DB6IBJVWHKYJOW	  A3NCFB0P70CNQU	  100% (1/1)	  GREENBERG It took me about 15 minutes. I think you were testing how the delivery or confidence of a statement alludes to someone lying or being truthful.	mtrack_loy 2
  3ATYLI1PRT2V62M4DB6IBJVWHKYJOW	  A67UM6SBQFETJ	  100% (1/1)	  GREENBERG Completed in 7 minutes with a score of 535. It was an enjoyable task, thank you!	mtrack_loy 2

  3ATYLI1PRT2V62M4DB6IBJVWHKYJOW	  A1JO4Z8LY6IDKB	  100% (2/2)	  GREENBERG The task took approximately four minutes. I'm guessing that the pauses in the words spoken were a test to see if they were perceived to be less truthful?	mtrack_loy 2

Ie assessing a recording alone is a limited approach which 'removes listeners from the immediacy and interactivity that characterise a typical act of lying.'
