You are being asked to participate in a study on lie detection.   
The study is interested in how accurately listeners decide whether a speaker is telling the truth or lying to them.   
During the experiment, you will see objects on a screen and hear a recording of a speaker, who will tell you which object has treasure hidden behind it.   
Your task is to click on the object that you believe the treasure is behind, based on whether you think the speaker is telling the truth or lying.   
The study should last for approximately 20 to 25 minutes.
