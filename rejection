We were not able to accept this work because the responses were so fast that it's not possible that the full sound file had played before a decision was made.  As per the instructions, you must listen to the object mentioned (as in "the treasure is behind the CHAIR") before making your decision.  Repeated clicks that were made before the sound file had played are not in keeping with those instructions.

We were not able to accept this work because there was no evidence to suggest that you completed the task in full, and you did not provide the correct completion code (given at the end of the task).


We were not able to accept this work because you have already participated in this study (have already taken one of our previous HITs titled ORWELL within the last month).
